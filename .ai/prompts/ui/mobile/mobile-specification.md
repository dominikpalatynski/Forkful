I decided on option #1. As a frontend, React and Tailwind specialist, create a business specification of changes in the these components. Add information about @.ai/tech-stack.md . The specification should not contain implementation details, but only references to components. Make sure that the behavior of panels in desktop mode will not be violated.

Save the specification in the file in the .ai/ui/mobile-navigation.md folder
