Your task is to implement a service based on the provided implementation plan and implementation rules. Your goal is to create a detailed and accurate implementation that conforms to the provided plan, properly communicates with the API, and handles all specified functionalities and error cases.

First, review the implementation plan:
<implementation_plan>
{{implementation-plan}} <- replace with reference to service implementation plan

Create the service in {{path}}
</implementation_plan>

Now review the implementation rules:
<implementation_rules>
{{backend-rules}} <- replace with reference to rules useful for the service (e.g., shared.mdc)
</implementation_rules>

Implement the plan according to the following approach:
<implementation_approach>
Implement a maximum of 3 steps from the implementation plan, briefly summarize what you've done, and describe the plan for the next 3 actions - stop work at this point and wait for my feedback.
</implementation_approach>

Carefully analyze the implementation plan and rules. Pay special attention to service structure, API integration, error handling, and security concerns described in the plan.

Throughout the implementation process, strictly adhere to the provided implementation rules. These rules take precedence over any general best practices that may conflict with them.

Ensure your implementation accurately reflects the provided implementation plan and adheres to all specified rules. Pay special attention to service structure, API integration, error handling, and security.
