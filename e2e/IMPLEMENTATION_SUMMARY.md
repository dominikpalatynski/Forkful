# E2E Authentication Setup - Implementation Summary

## What We Achieved

### 1. Created Authentication Setup System
- ✅ Single authentication that runs once before all tests
- ✅ Session state stored and reused across all test suites
- ✅ Faster test execution (no repeated logins)
- ✅ Stored in `playwright/.auth/user.json`

### 2. Added Test Selectors
Added `data-testid` attributes to login form components:
- `auth-input-email` → Email input field
- `auth-input-password` → Password input field
- `auth-submit-button` → Submit button

### 3. Updated Playwright Configuration
- Configured setup project to run before tests
- Enabled storage state for session persistence
- Set up dependency chain (tests depend on auth setup)

### 4. Environment Configuration
- E2E credentials stored in `.env.integration`
- Variables: `E2E_USERNAME`, `E2E_PASSWORD`

## Key Technical Solutions

### Problem 1: React Hook Form Button Disabled
**Issue:** Submit button disabled due to `!form.formState.isDirty`

**Solution:** Use `pressSequentially()` instead of `fill()` to trigger onChange events properly

```typescript
// ✅ Works - triggers form dirty state
await input.pressSequentially(value, { delay: 30 });

// ❌ Doesn't work - doesn't trigger dirty state
await input.fill(value);
```

### Problem 2: Browser Autocomplete Interference
**Issue:** Autocomplete was causing partial values ("t@mail.com" instead of "e2e_test@mail.com")

**Solution:** Triple-click to select all, then type

```typescript
// Select all existing text (including autocomplete)
await input.click({ clickCount: 3 });

// Type to replace selected text
await input.pressSequentially(value, { delay: 30 });
```

### Problem 3: React Hydration Timing
**Issue:** Form not ready immediately after page load

**Solution:** Wait for network idle + additional timeout

```typescript
await page.goto(url, { waitUntil: 'networkidle' });
await page.waitForTimeout(500); // Safety margin for hydration
```

## Critical Lessons: Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ DO These in Future E2E Tests:

| Practice | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Use `data-testid` attributes | Stable selectors that won't break with UI changes |
| Use `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` for React/Astro pages | Ensures full hydration before interaction |
| Use `pressSequentially()` with React Hook Form | Properly triggers onChange and dirty state |
| Triple-click before typing in inputs | Handles autocomplete reliably |
| Wait for element state before interaction | Prevents "element not enabled" errors |
| Store auth state and reuse | Faster tests, runs login once |
| Use environment variables for credentials | Security and flexibility |

### ❌ AVOID These:

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Better Approach |
|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| `fill()` with React Hook Form | Doesn't trigger dirty state | `pressSequentially()` |
| Text-based selectors | Breaks with copy changes | `data-testid` attributes |
| Skipping page readiness waits | Race conditions, flaky tests | `waitUntil: 'networkidle'` |
| Platform-specific shortcuts (`Control+a`) | Fails on different OS | `click({ clickCount: 3 })` |
| Hardcoded credentials | Security risk | Environment variables |
| Login in every test | Slow test suite | Setup project + storage state |
| Ignoring timing issues | Flaky tests | Explicit waits and assertions |

## Quick Reference: Authentication Setup Flow

```
1. npm run test:e2e
   └─> Playwright starts

2. Setup Project Runs (once)
   ├─> Navigate to /auth/login
   ├─> Wait for networkidle
   ├─> Triple-click email input
   ├─> Type email with pressSequentially
   ├─> Triple-click password input
   ├─> Type password with pressSequentially
   ├─> Wait for button to be enabled
   ├─> Click submit button
   ├─> Wait for navigation to /recipes
   ├─> Verify "Nowy przepis" button visible
   └─> Save auth state to playwright/.auth/user.json

3. Test Projects Run (chromium, etc.)
   └─> Load auth state from user.json
   └─> All tests run as authenticated user
   └─> No need to login again
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI mode (recommended for development)
npx playwright test --ui

# Run specific test
npx playwright test e2e/tests/base.spec.ts

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug

# Headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Show last report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Next Steps & Future Improvements

- [ ] Add page object models for complex pages
- [ ] Create reusable test helpers/fixtures
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add API mocking for faster tests
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter problems:

1. Check `test-results/` for screenshots and error context
2. Run in debug mode: `npx playwright test --debug`
3. Review `e2e/README.md` for detailed documentation
4. Check Playwright docs: https://playwright.dev
